# bproxym
this script is loosely based on Justin Seitz's proxy from his book Black Hat Python. i modified it to act as a proxy for http traffic only and to be used via a web broswer. this version has options to view, edit and intercept the http requests or responses.

it is a transparent http proxy useful for viewing/ capturing http traffic to/from your browser.
